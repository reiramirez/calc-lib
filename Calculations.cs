         * What we need to accomplish:
         * 
         * 1. Basic maths (baby mode):
         * 
         * - Basic integer operations
         * - Basic fraction operations
         * - Decimal rounding
         * - Mean, median, and mode
         * 
         * 2. Complex maths (if math is so good, why didn't they make a math 2?):
         * 
         * - Prime factorization
         * - Babylonian method for getting square roots
         * - Quake3D's fast inverse square root (just as an example)
         *
